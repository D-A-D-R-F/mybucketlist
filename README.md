#### How it works...

 - We suggest a random activity from your bucket list for you to complete on a particular day.

It consists of 3 main features : - 
1. A Google link to the topic which provides useful information.
2. 5 Youtube videos on the topic.
3. A Google Map based on the topic.

 - Note: You will not able to access this feature if your bucket list is empty!
